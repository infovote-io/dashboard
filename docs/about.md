# Data
The data is fetched automatically every month and updated. If a specific country you care about is missing, this is because the latest version of the data did not include that country[^1].

# About
This application was built as a solution to address the End Bias in Retrospective Voting. The code is open source and MIT licensed and can be found on Github.

The data used by this application comes from [FRED API](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A229RX0#0) and the [World Bank API](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.ADJ.NNTY.PC.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true). The data was then converted into a simplified table by taking the latest available data for every country. The source data used by this application is on [Github](https://github.com/infovote-io/) along with the code (Last Updated: Sep 2023).For any questions or concerns with the data or this app, please contact us on Twitter or by email on help at infovote dot io.

[^1]: Data on the US is available. Mexico, Brazil, and the G20 countries will follow.
