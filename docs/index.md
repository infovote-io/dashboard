# How would you evaluate these economies?
Let's start with a simple test, in your opinion which economy had a better performance?

- Evaluate each economy from 1 to 10

```vegalite

}
```

Even when presented with data from all years of a President's Term in a simple format, most participants put substantially more weight on the economy in the final year of presidents’ terms.

- To illustrate this behavior, consider the two examples in *Figure 1*. In the left panel, which shows Bill Clinton’s first term, growth was only moderate on average, but ends on a relatively strong note.

- In the right panel, which shows Jimmy Carter’s only term, growth was stronger in the first two years, but it slows substantially by the election year.

- Although **cumulative** income growth was the **same** during Carter’s term (5.9% versus 5.9% in Clinton’s), participants rated the economy during Clinton’s first term as much stronger.


## Election's Margin vs RDI Growth and Economy Evaluations
Over a series of experiments, @HealyLenz_2014[^1] reveal that participants tend to overweight the last year's performance, despite intending to weigh growth equally across all years. Results are shown in *Figure 2* below.

- The graph to the left presents the Vote Margin for each election and the RDI Growth Rate, while the second one the Vote Margin and the Economic Evaluations by participants.

## Why is this happening?
- The end bias, a cognitive tendency to substitute the end for the whole, plays a significant role in voters' evaluations of economic performance.

- The concept of “Attribute Substitution”, illustrated by [@Kahneman_2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00589.x) and @KahnemanFred_2002, reveals how individuals unconsciously replace a target attribute with a more readily accessible, related attribute when making judgments.

- This phenomenon, exemplified in experiments by @KahnemanEtal_1993 involving immersion of hands in cold water, showcases people's inclination to remember experiences based on peak and end conditions, termed the "Peak-End Rule."

- This bias extends to diverse retrospective evaluations ranging from vacations to colonoscopies that underly the tendency to substitute overall assessments with easily accessible peak and end information (e.g., @Loewestein_1993; @Baumgarten_1997; @Ross_1991; @ZauDieAriely_2006).
